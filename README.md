Description: Dhaka's parks play a crucial role in maintaining ecological balance and urban social cohesion. The Smart Park Enhancement System (SPES) aims to enhance 
these functions by integrating IoT devices, sensors, and advanced technology. This strategy promotes health, community ties, and environmental protection, while also 
reducing pollution and protecting ecosystems. This innovative approach aims to enhance the quality of life for city dwellers. By implementing cutting-edge technologies 
like automatic flood gates, water quality monitoring systems, weather predictions, children tracking systems, and an Internet of Things-based park map, the Smart 
Automatic Park project seeks to enhance both the tourist experience and park administration. These elements sustain the lives of nearby fishermen, control the 
level of water in park lakes, and safeguard aquatic life. A kid tracking device also helps senior family members suffering from Alzheimer's disease and guarantees 
the safety of toddlers. The workload of park employees is decreased, and overall park experiences are improved by the integration of current technologies such as 
RFID-based ticket systems, motion-activated lighting, water cleaning systems, smart feeding systems, and IoT-based emergency help.A smart park enhancement system is 
being implemented in Dhaka to improve park management and tourist experiences. The system makes use of cutting-edge technological advancements, including weather prediction 
tools, automated flood gates, and water quality monitoring devices. The goal is to offer tourists safer recreational areas and to make parks more resilient to changes in the 
environment. Despite funding limitations and public involvement, the project seeks to position Dhaka's parks as role models for sustainable development. With the integration of 
cutting-edge technology like augmented reality and artificial intelligence, the system will spread to metropolitan regions and establish Dhaka as a worldwide leader in urban innovation.
